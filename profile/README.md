## Welcome to the Earth Information System GitHub organization!

The EIS synthesizes discipline-specific understanding into Earth system understanding, with relevance to applications and enabled by emerging cyberinfrastructure. The synthesized system understanding is curated by the core EIS team but driven by community input and feedback.

An overview of EIS, with more information on project goals, can be found here: https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/eis

This GitHub organization serves as the hub for community input into EIS. This organization will house repositories for:
1. Interactive science analyses (e.g., Jupyter notebooks)
1. VEDA Discoveries, visualizations, and dashboards
1. Technical documentation
1. Other code (e.g., scripts, tools, packages/libraries, SDKs, etc.)

## Workflow for submitting comment or starting a discussion:
If you have a GitHub account, open a GitHub Issue within a particular repository.

If you do not have a GitHub account, there will be an alternate way to submit feedback. Stay tuned!

## Workflow for submitting code or analysis to EIS:
1. Fork an EIS repository
1. Make changes
1. Submit a pull request
